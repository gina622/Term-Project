# Term-Project
This is the repository for my term project.

Term Project Member: Gina Zheng (individual)


### 1. The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you accomplish? Describe your minimum viable product (MVP) and your stretch goal.

The main idea of my project that I want to do is to build a content aggregator. This idea first originated from the links of project ideas listed in the assignment description under 2. Project Topic. In realpython.com, it describes that a content aggregator will get the information from all over the internet and gather it into one place. Specifically, for this project, I want to build a content aggregator for news articles from different news sources, mainly focusing on finance news. The reason for this is, as a business student, I should be keeping up with news related to the industry as it is relevant to my career path. However, it could be hard sometimes to constantly look up finance news articles, especially when different sources can provide different perspectives on the issues reported. My end goal would be to create a webpage that collects all the information from different sources to make it more convenient for me to keep up with what is happening currently.

### 2. Learning Objectives: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

Through this project, I want to further improve my skills of integrating different coding languages in order to create a webpage. From python working as the backend to HTML as the frontend, I want to be able to make something that will be useful to me and maybe to other people as well. 

### 3. Implementation Plan: This part may be somewhat ambiguous initially. You might have identified a library or a framework that you believe would be helpful for your project at this early stage. If you're uncertain about executing your project plan, provide a rough plan describing how you'll investigate this information further.

Learning about this project on realpython.com and thinking about the implementation of this, there would be a few libraries that can be helpful with the process. First, HTML is must in order to create the template of the webpage. The library BeautifulSoup would also be very helpful in the sense that I want to scrape the neccessary content from various websites. On top of that, Flask may also be helpful to route pages and to pull variables to the HTML templates. At the very end, realpython.com suggested that I have a database to save the content scrapped from various sites. Not sure if SQLite would be helpful but I will try to implement it in if I find it to be necessary.

### 4. Project Schedule: You have 6 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Draft a general timeline for your project. Depending on your project, you might be able to provide a detailed schedule or only an overview. Preparation of a longer project is also accompanied by present uncertainty, and this schedule will likely require revisions as the project progresses.

Seeing that there are three weeks left from this date, I want to plan accordingly for the three weeks. During the first week, I would want to have the basic framework of the website ready and figure out all the sources that I want to use and which specific content I want to scrap out. For the second week, I would want to have done all the web scraping, have my database if needed and have the basic framework of the end product completed. For the last week, I want to edit the site and make it presentable with the work of CSS. At this point, I would also want to have already all the errors corrected in the end so the final product will be presentable and ready for use. 

### 5. Collaboration Plan: How will you collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you divide tasks and then incorporate them separately? Will you undertake a comprehensive pair program? Explain how you'll ensure effective team collaboration. This may also entail information on any software development methodologies you anticipate using (e.g. agile development). Be sure to clarify why you've picked this specific organizational structure.

I will be working on the term project by myself individually so collaboration will not be a problem in my case. During the process, I would want to use the agile method of workflow. I would want to clear up any errors in each stage of the project before moving on to the next stage. 

### 6. Risks and Limitations: What do you believe is the most significant threat to this project's success?

I believe that the biggest limitation for my project would be my lack of knowledge on certain libraries or frameworks. For example, realpython.com talked about using libraries such as celery or apscheduler for background processes so I would probably have to learn about these libraries before implementing them. This may result in a delay on the schedule I planned to finish the project. 

### 7. Additional Course Content: What topics do you believe will be beneficial to your project?

The topics that I believe will be beneficial to my project includes the usage of Flask, databased, and web scrapping. Through the sessions in class, we got familiar with libraries in each case. The usage of these lessons learned from class will be helpful during my project making process.
